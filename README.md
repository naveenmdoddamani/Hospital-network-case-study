# Hospital-network-case-study
To know about the network topology, present in the hospital, identifying gaps and implementing the gaps identified.


# Methodology

• 5 routers are connected to each other by Mesh topology.                                                                                                                 
• Each floor has one switch.                                                                                                                                             
• Each floor has Wi-fi networks connected to laptops and phones.                                                                                                         
• Each floor is in different VLAN.                                                                                                                                       
• Using OSPF as routing protocol to advertise routers.                                                                                                                   
• All the devices in network communicate with each other.                                                                                                                 
• Configuring HTTP, SMTP and AAA services.                                                                                                                               
• All devices obtain IP dynamically with their router configured as DHCP server.                                                                                         
• All routers connected to each other using serial DCE cable.
